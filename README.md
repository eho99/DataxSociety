## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

**Crowd Controlled** is a web application that empowers users to collaboratively share data and machine learning models. With a user-friendly platform, it facilitates open collaboration between data seekers and data providers, making it a valuable resource for businesses, researchers, and data enthusiasts.

- Democratize access to data and machine learning models.
- Accelerate innovation and knowledge sharing.
- Create a global community of data contributors and machine learning practitioners.

## <a name="inspiration"></a>Inspiration
This probject was born out of an interest in the social dynamics of Internet phenomenon like r/place. Events like this have the capacity to speak to the power of collaboration and the goodwill of individuals who may have never met and may never meet again, but work to create and share across the Internet. We have a dream of seeing problem solvers and interested, good-willed individuals contributing to CrowdControlled to push data collection, machine learning education, and problem solving to the next level by creating projects and running experiments.
